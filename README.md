'Reseptini' is a recipe application that works only on mobile phones.

Recipe App provides two functions. In the forefront it is a recipe application where you can download your own recipes. With the help of WordPress custom posts it retains information of recipes ingredients and phases that needs to be performed to make a wanted dish.

Secondly Reseptini is capable to keep list of ingredients and products that you are willing to buy from a shop. You can add items to Reseptini's shoppinglist through a form or you can add them directly from recipes.

Reseptini uses multiple tools, frameworks and languages in order to work:
<ul>
  <li>WordPress Custom Theme</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>JS</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>SASS</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Gulp</li>
</ul>

There are also few plugins that are necessary:
<ul>
  <li>Advanced Custom Fields <b>Pro</b></li>
  <li>(Polylang)</li>
  <li>(Password Protected)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are willing to modify the code you have to download the repo and then add node modules folder to the Reseptini folder. After that you can ran Gulp in your terminal and install necessary modules to run Gulp. You need to remind also that this browser based application is also made for the WordPress when you are testing it locally. After the modifications you can get rid of the gulpfile, node modules, styles and scirpts folders, gitignore and padkage-lock files.</p>
